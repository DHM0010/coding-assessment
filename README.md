  ## Description
  In this Homework I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a website that runs a ten question quiz that can save your initials as well as each score.

  ## Instalation
  N/A

  ## Credits
  N/A

  ## Usage
  To operate this website click on the start quiz button, when you press the button the first question along with a 75 second timer show up. when you answer a question if you get it correct it will automatically take you to the next question, if you get it wrong, the timer stops and it issues an alert telling you your answer was incorrect. Upon finishing the quiz the timer automatically stops and you will get a prompt to enter your initials, once that is done your score along with your initials will appear on the left side of the page.
